# osmgeosample
osmgeosample â€“ for generating a sample from a population of spatial locations of buildings from OpenStreetMap.org

The main idea is to build a user friendly toolkit for using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data as a basis for generating spatially regulated samples which should be useful for researchers and practitioners. 

180620 is HC's first full day working and I am reviewing all of the code in "osmdata" and geosample. I am also setting up my infastructure such as my files, email, github account etc. Here I am testing whether I can make pull requests on a new branch
