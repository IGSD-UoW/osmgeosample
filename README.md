# osmgeosample
osmgeosample â€“ for generating a sample from a population of spatial locations of buildings from OpenStreetMap.org

The main idea is to build a user friendly toolkit for using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data as a basis for generating spatially regulated samples which should be useful for researchers and practitioners in doing surveys.
