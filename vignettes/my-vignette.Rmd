## An R Package for Geostatistical Sampling Designs with OSM data
### Henry Crosby, Godwin Yeobah, J. Porto De Albuquerque

**Abstract**:
We introduce a new *R* package, *OSMGeosample*, for constructing geostatistical sampling designs with OSM data. The new package implements classes of \textit{adaptive} and \textit{non-adaptive} probability-based sampling designs. We illustrate the use of the package through the construction of several sampling designs, using a boundary dataset and OSM building data for a slum in Idikan.

**Keywords**: inhibitory sampling designs, geostatistics, *R*

## Introduction

osmdata is an R package for downloading and using data from OpenStreetMap (OSM). OSM is a global open access mapping project, which is free and open under the ODbL licence (OpenStreetMap contributors 2017). This has many benefits, ensuring transparent data provenance and ownership, enabling real-time evolution of the database and, by allowing anyone to contribute, encouraging democratic decision making and citizen science (Johnson 2017). See the OSM wiki to find out how to contribute to the world’s open geographical data commons.

Unlike the OpenStreetMap package, which facilitates the download of raster tiles, osmdata provides access to the vector data underlying OSM.

osmdata can be installed from CRAN with

## OSM Random Sampling (osm.random.sample)

**Description**:

This function draws a spatially random sample from a either (1)
 a discrete set of OSM features defined in the function parameters or (2) a
 continuous surface defined by a user definted geographical region.

**Parameters**:

*bounding_geom* a \code{sf} or \code{sp} object (with \eqn{N \geq
 \code{size}}) where each line corresponds to one spatial location. It
 should contain values of 2D coordinates, data and, optionally, covariate(s)
 value(s) at the locations. This argument must be provided when sampling
 from a \code{'discrete'} set of points, see \code{'type'} below for
 details.

*dis_or_cont* random sampling, a choice of either \code{'discrete'},
 from a set of \eqn{N} potential sampling points or \code{'continuum'} from
 independent, compeletely random points.

*sample_size* a non-negative integer giving the total number of
 locations to be sampled.

*plotit* 'logical' specifying if graphical output is required. Default
 is \code{plotit = TRUE}.

*plotit_leaflet* 'logical' specifying if leaflet (html) graphical output
 is required. This is prioritised over plotit if both are selected. Default
 is \code{plotit_leaflet = TRUE}.

*boundary* categorical variable to determine whether the exact boundary
 provided (\code{boundary = 0}), the bounding box \code{boundary = 1}) or a
 buffer around the boundary \code{boundary = 2}) is used for sampling.
 Default is \code{boundary = 0}.

*buff_dist* if \code{boundary = 2} then this value determines the size
 of the buffer by distance. The default is \code{buff_dist is NULL}).

*buff_epsg* if \code{boundary = 2} then this value determines the local
 geographic grid reference so that the buffer can be calculated in meters.
 The default is  \code{buff_epsg = 4326}) which will use decimal degrees
 instead of meters. As an example, 27700 relates to the British National
 Grid.

*join_type* a text value to determine how to spatially join all features
 with the boundary. The options are 'within' or 'intersect'.

*key* A feature key as defined in OSM. An example is 'building'.

*value* a value for a feature key (\code{key}); can be negated with an
 initial exclamation mark, value = '!this', and can also be a vector, value
 = c ('this', 'that').

*data_return* specifies what data types (as specified in OSM) you want
 returned. More than one can be selected. The options are 'osm_polygons',
 'osm_points', 'osm_multipolygons','osm_multilines','osm_lines'.

**Returns**:

A \code{df} object named 'results' of dimension \eqn{n} by \code{4}
 containing the final sampled \code{osm_ids}, centroid locations (named
 \code{x,y}) and whether the instance is in the selected sample (named
 \code{inSample} with a value of \code{0/1}), if sampling from a
 \code{'discrete'} set of points. A \code{df} object of dimension \eqn{n} by
 \code{3} containing the serial id and centroid locations for all sample
 instances,if sampling from a \code{'continuum'}.

## OSM Inhibitory Sampling with Discrete Data (osm.discrete.inhibit.sample)


**Description**: Draw a spatially discrete sample from a specified set of OSM
  spatial locations within a polygonal sampling region according to an
  \bold{'inhibitory plus close pairs'} specification.
  
**Parameters**: 

*delta* The minimum permissible distance between any two locations in
  preliminary sample. This can be allowed to vary with number of \code{'close
  pairs'} if a \bold{simple inhibitory} design is compared to one of the
  \bold{inhibitory plus close pairs} design.

*delta.fix* A 'logical' input which specifies whether \code{'delta'} is
  fixed or allowed to vary with number of close pairs \eqn{k}. Default is
  \code{delta.fix = FALSE}.

*k* The number of close-pair locations in the sample. It must be an
  integer between 0 and \code{size}/2.

*cp.criterion* The criterion for choosing close pairs \eqn{k}. The
  \code{'cp.zeta'} criterion chooses locations not included in the initial
  sample, from the uniform distribution of a disk with radius \code{'zeta'}
  (NB: \code{zeta} argument must be provided for this criterion). The
  \code{'cp.neighb'} criterion chooses nearest neighbours amongst locations
  not included in the initial sample (\code{'zeta'} becomes trivial for
  \code{'cp.neighb'} criterion).

*zeta* The maximum permissible distance (radius of a disk with center
  \eqn{x^{*}_{j}, j = 1, \ldots, k}) within which a close-pair point is
  placed. See \bold{Details}.

*ntries* The number of rejected proposals after which the algorithm
  terminates.

*plotit* A 'logical' input specifying if a graphical output is required.
  Default is \code{plotit = TRUE}.

*bounding_geom* A \code{sf} or \code{sp} with each line corresponding to
  one spatial location. It should contain values of 2D coordinates. This
  argument must be provided when sampling from a \code{'discrete'} set of
  locations defined in OSM.

*sample_size* A non-negative integer giving the total number of
  locations to be sampled.

*plotit_leaflet* A 'logical' input specifying if leaflet (html)
  graphical output is required. This is prioritised over plotit if both are
  selected. Default is \code{plotit_leaflet = TRUE}.

*boundary* A categorical variable to determine whether the exact
  boundary (\code{boundary = 0}), the bounding box \code{boundary = 1}) or a
  buffer around the boundary \code{boundary = 2}) is used for sampling. The
  default is \code{boundary = 0}.

*buff_dist* If \code{boundary = 2}) then this value determines the size
  of the buffer by distance. The default is \code{buff_dist is NULL}).

*buff_epsg* If \code{boundary = 2}) then this value determines the local
  geographic grid reference so that the buffer can be calculated in meters.
  The default is \code{buff_epsg = 4326}) which will use decimal degrees
  instead of meters. As an example, 27700 relates to the British National
  Grid.

*join_type* A text value to determine how to spatially join all features
  with the boundary. The options are 'within' or 'intersect'.

*key* A feature key as defined in OSM. An example is 'building'.

*value* A value for a feature key (\code{key}); can be negated with an
  initial exclamation mark, value = '!this', and can also be a vector, value
  = c ('this', 'that'). More details at
  \url{https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features}.

*data_return* A list which specifies what data types (as specified in
  OSM) you want returned. More than one can be selected. The options are
  'osm_polygons', 'osm_points',
  'osm_multipolygons','osm_multilines','osm_lines'.

**Details** 

To draw a sample of size \eqn{n} from a population of spatial
  locations \eqn{X_{i} : i  = 1,\ldots,N}, with the property that the
  distance between any two sampled locations is at least \eqn{\delta}, the
  function implements the following algorithm. \itemize{ \item{Step 1.} Draw
  an initial sample of size \eqn{n}  completely at random and call this
  \eqn{x_{i}  : i  = 1,\dots, n}. \item{Step 2.} Set \eqn{i  = 1}. \item{Step
  3.} Calculate the smallest distance, \eqn{d_{\min}}, from \eqn{x_{i}}  to
  all other \eqn{x_{j}}  in the initial sample. \item{Step 4.} If
  \eqn{d_{\min} \ge \delta}, increase \eqn{i}  by 1 and return to step 2 if
  \eqn{i \le n}, otherwise stop. \item{Step 5.} If \eqn{d_{\min} < \delta},
  draw an integer \eqn{j}  at random from \eqn{1,  2,\ldots,N}, set
  \eqn{x_{i}  = X_{j}}  and return to step 3.}

  Samples generated in this way exhibit  more regular spatial arrangements
  than would random samples of the same size. The degree of regularity
  achievable will be influenced by the spatial arrangement of the population
  \eqn{X_{i}  : i  = 1,\ldots,N}, the specified value of \eqn{\delta}  and
  the sample size \eqn{n}. For any given population, if \eqn{n}  and/or
  \eqn{\delta} is too large, a sample of the required size with the distance
  between any two sampled locations at least \eqn{\delta} will not be
  achievable; the algorithm will then find \eqn{n_{s} < n} points that can be
  placed for the given parameters.

  \bold{Sampling close pairs of points.}

  For some purposes, typically when using the same sample for parameter
  estimation and spatial prediction, it is desirable that a spatial sampling
  scheme include pairs of closely spaced points \eqn{x}. The function offers
  two ways of specifying close pairs, either as the closest available
  unsampled point to an existing sampled point \code{(cp.critetrion =
  cp.neighb)}, or as a random choice from amongst all available unsampled
  points within distance \eqn{zeta} of an existing sampled point
  \code{(cp.criterion = cp.zeta)}. The algorithm proceeds as follows.

  Let \eqn{k} be the required number of close pairs. \itemize{ \item{Step 1.}
  Construct a simple inhibitory design \bold{SI}\eqn{(n - k, \delta)}.
  \item{Step 2.} Sample \eqn{k} from \eqn{x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n - k}} without
  replacement and call this set \eqn{x_{j} : j = 1, \ldots, k}. \item{Step
  3.} For each \eqn{x_{j}: j = 1, \ldots, k}, select a close pair
  \eqn{x_{n-k+j}} according to the specified criterion.}

  \bold{Note:} Depending on the spatial configuration of potential sampling
  locations and, when the selection criterion \code{cp.criterion = cp.zeta},
  the specified value of \eqn{zeta}, it is possible that one or more of the
  selected points  \eqn{x_{j}} in Step 2 will not have an eligible ``close
  pair''. In this case, the algorithm will try  find an alternative
  \eqn{x_{j}} and report a warning if it fails to do so.

**return**: a list with the following four components:

**return**: \code{unique.locs:} the number of unique sampled locations.

**return**: \code{delta:} the value of \eqn{\delta} after taking into account the
  number of close pairs \eqn{k}. If \code{delta.fix = TRUE}, this will be
  \eqn{\delta} input by the user.

**return**: \eqn{k:} the number of close pairs included in the sample (for
  \bold{inhibitory plus close pairs} design).

**return**: \code{sample.locs:} a \code{sf} or \code{sp} object containing the
  final sampled locations and any associated values.

**Note**: If \code{'delta'} is set to 0, a completely random sample is generated.
  In this case, \emph{'close pairs'} are not permitted and \code{'zeta'}
  becomes trivial.

## OSM Inhibitory Sampling with Continuous Data (osm.contin.inhibit.sample)

**description**: Draws a spatially continous sample of locations within a
  polygonal sampling region according to an \bold{'inhibitory plus close
  pairs'} specification. The region can be defined using OSM data or a user
  defined polygon.

**Parameters**:
*bounding_geom* a \code{sf} or \code{sp} object (with \eqn{N \geq
  \code{size}}) where each line corresponds to one spatial location. It
  should contain values of 2D coordinates, data and, optionally, covariate(s)
  value(s) at the locations. This argument must be provided when sampling
  from a \code{'discrete'} set of points, see \code{'type'} below for
  details.

*sample_size* a non-negative integer giving the total number of
  locations to be sampled.

*plotit* 'logical' specifying if graphical output is required. Default
  is \code{plotit = TRUE}.

*plotit_leaflet* 'logical' specifying if leaflet (html) graphical output
  is required. This is prioritised over plotit if both are selected. Default
  is \code{plotit_leaflet = TRUE}.

*boundary* categorical variable to determine whether the exact boundary
  provided (\code{boundary = 0}), the bounding box \code{boundary = 1}) or a
  buffer around the boundary \code{boundary = 2}) is used for sampling.
  Default is \code{boundary = 0}.

*buff_dist* if \code{boundary = 2}) then this value determines the size
  of the buffer by distance. The default is \code{buff_dist is NULL}).

*buff_epsg* if \code{boundary = 2}) then this value determines the local
  geographic grid reference so that the buffer can be calculated in meters.
  The default is  \code{buff_epsg = 4326}) which will use decimal degrees
  instead of meters. As an example, 27700 relates to the British National
  Grid.

*delta* minimum permissible distance between any two locations in
  preliminary sample. This can be allowed to vary with the number of
 \code{'close pairs'} if a \bold{simple inhibitory} design is compared to
  one of the \bold{inhibitory plus close pairs} design.

*delta.fix* 'logical' specifies whether \code{delta} is fixed or allowed
to vary with number of close pairs \eqn{k}. Default is \code{delta.fix =
  FALSE}.

*k* number of locations in preliminary sample to be replaced by near
  neighbours of other preliminary sample locations to form \code{close pairs}
  (integer between 0 and \code{size/2}). A \bold{simple inhibitory} deisgn is
  generated when \eqn{k = 0}.

*rho* maximum distance between the two locations in a
 \code{'close-pair'}.

*ntries* number of rejected proposals after which the algorithm will terminate.


**Details**:  To draw a simple inhibitory (\bold{SI}) sample of size \code{n}
  from a spatially continuous region \eqn{A}, with the property that the
  distance between any two sampled locations is at least \code{delta}, the
  following algorithm is used. \itemize{ \item{Step 1.} Set \eqn{i  = 1} and
  generate a point \eqn{x_{1}}  uniformly distributed on \eqn{{\cal D}}.
  \item{Step 2.} Generate a point \eqn{x}  uniformly distributed on
  \eqn{{\cal D}} and calculate the minimum, \eqn{d_{\min}}, of the distances
  from \eqn{x_{i}} to all \eqn{x_{j}: j \leq i }. \item{Step 3.} If
  \eqn{d_{\min} \ge \delta}, increase \eqn{i}  by 1, set \eqn{x_{i} = x} and
  return to step 2 if \eqn{i \le n}, otherwise stop; \item{Step 4.} If
  \eqn{d_{\min} < \delta}, return to step 2 without increasing \eqn{i}. }

  \bold{Sampling close pairs of points.}

  For some purposes, it is desirable that a spatial sampling scheme include
  pairs of closely spaced points, resulting in an inhibitory plus close pairs
  (\bold{ICP}) design. In this case, the above algorithm requires the
  following additional steps to be taken. Let \eqn{k}  be the required number
  of close pairs. Choose a value \code{rho}  such that a close pair  of
  points will be a pair of points separated by a distance of at most
  \code{rho}. \itemize{ \item{Step 5.} Set \eqn{j  = 1} and draw a random
  sample of size 2 from integers \eqn{1, 2, \ldots, n}, say \eqn{(i_1, i_2)};
  \item{Step 6.} Replace \eqn{x_{i_{1}}} by \eqn{x_{i_{2}} + u} , where
  \eqn{u}  is uniformly distributed on the disc with centre \eqn{x_{i_{2}}}
  and radius \code{rho}, increase \eqn{i} by 1 and return to step 5 if \eqn{i
  \le k}, otherwise stop. }

  When comparing a \bold{SI} design to one of the \bold{ICP} designs, the
  inhibitory components should have the same degree of spatial regularity.
  This requires \eqn{\delta} to become a function of \eqn{k} namely
  \deqn{\delta_{k} = \delta_{0}\sqrt{n/(n - k)}} with \eqn{\delta_{0}} held


*returns*: a list with the following four components:
*returns*: \code{size:} the total number of sampled locations.
*returns*: \code{delta:} the value of \eqn{\delta} after taking into account the
  number of close pairs \eqn{k}. If \code{delta.fix = TRUE}, this will be
  \eqn{\delta} input by the user.
*returns*: \eqn{k:} the number of close pairs included in the sample (for
  \bold{inhibitory plus close pairs} design).
*returns*: \code{sample.locs:} a \code{sf} or \code{sp} object containing
  coordinates of dimension \code{n} by 2 containing the sampled locations.

**note**: If \code{'delta'} is set to 0, a completely random sample is generated.
  In this case, \code{'close pairs'} are not permitted and \code{rho} is
  irrelevant.

## Additional Functionality

## Related Packages

osmgeosample builds on Chipeta and Diggle (2019) R package named geosample, which is used for the construction of Geostatistical sampling designs. Note that the geosample package is not present on CRAN, and can not be used for accessing OSM data. osmgeosample utilises a popular OSM mapping r package osmdata which is authored and maintained by Mark Padgham and Robin Lovelace.  In addition, the Mapview R package allows us display our restuls on an interactive map (Appelhans et al,2020)
